The goal of this machine problem is to write a simulator for L1 data cache. It simulates the cache behavior with RR replacement policy and returns the hit/miss count.

# Contents
 * Cache.java                --- the main class.
 * CacheSimulator.java       --- simulates the cache behavior with RR replacement policy and returns hit/miss.
 * CacheStat.java            --- generates the stats.

# Instruction 
 To run sample9.in with the simulator
 * $make
 * $java Cache 32 32 4 sample9.in mySample9.out
